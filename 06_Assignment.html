             HTML documents in earlier versions often had lengthy and complex DOCTYPE declarations, such as HTML 4.01 Strict or HTML 4.01 Transitional.

        <td>
             HTML5 introduced a simplified and standardized DOCTYPE declaration, which is as simple as <!DOCTYPE html>. This makes it easier to create and validate HTML documents.

    <tr>
        <td> HTML had a limited set of elements and attributes for structuring content. Many features that are common in modern web development were not available.</td>

        <td> HTML5 introduced numerous new elements and attributes. Some notable additions include <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <video>, <audio>, and <canvas>. These elements provide better semantic structuring for web content and enable native support for multimedia.</td>

                HTML5: HTML5 introduced native support for multimedia elements, such as <video> and <audio>, eliminating the need for third-party plugins in most cases. This makes multimedia content more accessible and standardized across browsers
