List out the features of HTML5.

HTML5, the fifth and latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several new features and improvements to enhance web development and user experience. Here's a list of some of the key features of HTML5:

Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and <aside>. These elements make it easier to structure web content in a meaningful way, improving accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

Audio and Video Support: HTML5 introduced the <audio> and <video> elements, which allow you to embed multimedia content directly into web pages without relying on third-party plugins like Flash.

Canvas: The <canvas> element provides a JavaScript-based, two-dimensional drawing API, allowing developers to create graphics, animations, and interactive games directly within the browser.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): HTML5 includes support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), enabling the creation of vector-based graphics that can be scaled without loss of quality.

Geolocation: HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that allows websites to request the user's geographic location, which can be useful for location-based services and applications.

Local Storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which enable web applications to store data locally on the user's device
